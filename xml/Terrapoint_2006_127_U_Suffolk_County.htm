<B>    Abstract:</B>
      LIDAR data is remotely sensed high-resolution elevation
      data collected by an airborne collection platform. By
      positioning laser range finding with the use of 1 second
      GPS with 100hz inertial measurement unit corrections;
      Terrapoint's LIDAR instruments are able to make highly
      detailed geospatial elevation products of the ground,
      man-made structures and vegetation. The
      LiDAR flightlines for this project was planned for a 50%
      acquisition overlap. The nominal resolution of this project
      without overlap is 1.25m (Optech) and 1m (ALTMS) spacing. Four
      returns were recorded for each pulse in addition to an
      intensity value. GPS Week Time, Echo, Intensity, Flightline number
      and scan angle attributes were provided for each LiDAR point.
      Data is provided as random points, in LAS v1.0 format,
      classified according to ASPRS Class Code 2=Ground 1=Undefined.
<B>    Purpose:</B>
      The purpose of this LiDAR data was to produce high accuracy
      3D elevation based geospatial products for coastal flood mapping.
<B>    Supplemental_Information:</B>
      Please note that the LiDAR intensity is not calibrated or
      normalized. The intensity value is meant to provide
      relative signal return strengths for features imaged by the
      sensor.
      Water is included in the bare earth ground model, except
      where the entire tile is covered by water.

        - General Overview
        The Airborne LiDAR survey was conducted using an OPTECH
        3100EA flying at a nominal height of 1550 metres AGL with a
        total angular coverage of 40 degrees and a Terrapoint ALTMS
        U5 flying at a nominal height of 1067 metres with a total
        angular coverage of 34 degrees . Flight line spacing was
        nominally 564 metres for the Optech and 164 metres for the
        ALTMS, providing overlap of 50% on adjacent flight lines.
        All of the lines were flown in a general east/west
        direction for the project. 
        - Aircraft
        Two aircrafts were used for the survey: a Piper Navajo,
        registration C-GPJT and a Cessna 402, registration C-FFAP.
        These aircrafts have a flight range of approximately 6.5
        and a 7 hours respectively and were flown at an average
        altitude of 1550 and 1067 metres AGL (Above Ground Level)
        respectively, thereby encountering flying altitudes of
        approximately 1550 and 1067 metres above Mean Sea Level
        (MSL) respectively. The aircrafts were staged from the
        Brookhaven NY Airport, and ferried daily to the project
        site for flight operations.
        - GPS Receivers
        A combination of Sokkia GSR 2600 and NovAtel DL-4+ dual
        frequency GPS receivers were used to support the airborne
        operations of this survey and to establish the GPS control
        network. 
        - Number of Flights and Flight Lines
        A total of 11 missions were flown for this project with
        flight times ranging approximately 42 hours under good
        meteorological and GPS conditions. A total of 262 flight lines
        were flown over the project area to provide complete coverage.
        The acquistion of this project was divided into two blocks to 
<B>        maintain resonable length flight lines:</B>
        East block = 107 flight lines
        West block = 155 flight lines

        - Airborne GPS Kinematic
        Airborne GPS kinematic data was processed on-site using
        GrafNav kinematic On-The-Fly (OTF) software. Flights were
        flown with a minimum of 6 satellites in view (13o above the
        horizon) and with a PDOP of better than 4.5. Distances from
        base station to aircraft were kept to a maximum of 35 km,
        to ensure a strong OTF (On-The-Fly) solution. For
        all flights, the GPS data can be classified as excellent,
        with GPS residuals of 5cm average but no larger than 9 cm
        being recorded. 
        - Calculation of 3D laser points (raw data)
        The post-processing software to derive X, Y, Z values from
        roll, pitch, yaw, and range is Optech's Realm. Data
        - Classification and Editing
        The data was processed using the software TerraScan, and
        following the methodology described herein. The initial
        step is the setup of the TerraScan project, which is done
        by importing client provided tile boundary index
        encompassing the entire project areas. The 3D laser point
        clouds, in binary format, were imported into the TerraScan
        project and divided in 5665 tiles, as per the contract
        specifications. tiled, the laser points were classified
        using a proprietary routine in TerraScan. This routine removes 
        any obvious outliers from the dataset following which the
        ground layer is extracted from the point cloud. The
        ground extraction process encompassed in this routine takes
        place by building an iterative surface model. This surface
        model is generated using three main parameters: building
        size, iteration angle and iteration distance. The
        initial model is based on low points being selected by a
        "roaming window" with the assumption is that these are the
        ground points. The size of this roaming window is
        determined by the building size parameter. The low points
        are triangulated and the remaining points are evaluated and
        subsequently added to the model if they meet the iteration
        angle and distance constraints. This process is repeated
        until no additional points are added within an iteration.
        A critical parameter is the maximum terrain angle
        constraint, which determines the maximum terrain angle
        allowed within the classification model. The
        data is then manually quality controlled with the use of
        hillshading, cross-sections and profiles. Any points found
        to be of class vegetation, building or error during the
        quality control process, are removed from the ground model
        and placed on the appropriate layer. An integrity check is
        also performed simultaneously to verify that ground
        features such as rock cuts, elevated roads and crests are
        present.  Once data has been cleaned and complete, it is 
        then reviewed by a supervisor via manual inspection and 
        through the use of a hillshade mosaic of the entire project 
        area.
        -Projection Transformation
        The data was processed in the native UTM zone in meters and
        then transformed to the New York Long Island State Plane
        final projection system and US survey feet using an
        in-house transformation software which uses the Coorpscon DLL.

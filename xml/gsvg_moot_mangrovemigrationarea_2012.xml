      <abstract>Two key datasets (among others) are needed to accurately model mangrove response to sea-level rise: accretion and erosion. Neither of these datasets were available in our study area and we were therefore unable to model how mangroves might specifically be impacted by SLR (i.e. how mangroves would be structured in space in the future based on SLR impacts). Given this limitation, we were only able to identify where mangroves could potentially move based on existing land use and land cover. A simple rule-based model was used to identify areas where mangroves could potentially move based on impediments to landward migration, and contiguity to existing mangroves. Mangrove migration impediments used in this analysis were buildings, roads, slopes greater than or equal to 10%, and elevations greater than or equal to 5 feet. In application, the mangrove migration analysis selected all landward areas that were contiguous to existing mangroves until it reached an abovementioned impediment. The results of the mangrove migration analysis were then included in the mangrove vulnerability analysis (represented as adaptive capacity potential).</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this effort was to spatially characterize mangrove vulnerability across the Grenadine Bank using the best available data. This work builds upon Gregg Moore’s Indices Report by incorporating selected measurable indices/variables (or proxies for indices) into a spatial model. This information will help inform the Nature Conservancy's AWE project. Scientists around the world agree that climate change is indisputable. Impacts, including rising sea levels, increased storm intensity, warming temperatures and acidifying waters, dying coral reefs, shifting fish stocks, and incidence of flooding and drought, are already being felt, and are expected to continue and increase for decades to come. Nature holds some of the world’s best and most practical solutions to climate change, solutions that keep nature and people healthy, safe, and secure. The goal of At the Water’s Edge (AWE) is to demonstrate that governments and people in vulnerable coastal communities in Grenada and St. Vincent &amp; the Grenadines (SVG) can enhance their resilience to climate change by protecting, restoring and effectively managing their marine and coastal ecosystems (also known as ecosystem-based adaptation or EBA) and strengthening local capacity for adaptation.</purpose>
